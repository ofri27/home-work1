                    <p class="list"> A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. 
                        Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.

                        Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.
                        "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. 
                        Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, 
                        which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.</p>

                    <h2 id="Wine"> <b> Wine Grapes </b> </h2>
                    <p class="list">  Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). 
                        Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. 
                        By comparison, commercially produced "100% grape juice", 
                        made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.

                        Seedless cultivars now make up the overwhelming majority of table grape plantings. 
                        Because grapevines are vegetatively propagated by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. 
                        It is an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent 
                        or rescue embryos early in development using tissue culture techniques.

                        Raisins are produced in many regions of the world and may be eaten raw or used in cooking, baking, and brewing. 
                        In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, the word raisin is reserved for the dark-colored dried large grape, 
                        with sultana being a golden-colored dried grape, and currant being a dried small Black Corinth seedless grape.

                        are nutrition powerhouses. They are packed with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that plays key roles in immune system health, 
                        connective tissue development, and wound healing. 
                        They are also a source of vitamin K, which helps with blood clotting and maintaining healthy bones: 
                        as well as potassium, which is important kidney and heart function, 
                        muscle contraction, and nerve signal transmission.Grapes are also rich in antioxidants, 
                        which help protect the body’s cells against oxidative stress, a mechanism linked to cancer, 
                        heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, darker grapes, 
                        such as Concord and purple varieties, are especially high in antioxidants. 
                        Grapes are the perfect addition to your 1.5 to 2 cups of recommended daily fruit intake, per the U.S. 
                        Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate guidelines.

                    <h2> How to Grow Grapes at Home? </h2>
                    <p> Growing grapes at home takes patience and commitment, as you’ll be cultivating and tending to the vines and harvests for a number of years. 
                        They can live up to a century, or even longer.
                        To get started, choose a warm site protected from high winds that gets at least six to eight hours of sunlight per day. 
                        Construct a trellis or arbor before planting so the vines will have a support structure to train them to grow upward. 
                        Buy one-year-old plants that are suitable to your local climate and geography from a reputable nursery, 
                        preferably ones that are certified to be virus-free.
